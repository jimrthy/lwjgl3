	    end, it is highly recommended that the application requests swap-texture-set formats that are in sRGB-space (e.g. {@code GL_SRGB_ALPHA8}) as the
	    distortion compositor does sRGB-correct rendering. Furthermore, the app should then make sure "{@code glEnable(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SRGB);}" is called before

	    linear-to-gamma conversion in GLSL, then the application can avoid calling "{@code glEnable(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SRGB);}", but should still pass in
